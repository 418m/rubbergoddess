# Faceshifter

This module allows users to self-assign some roles via commands or react-to-role mechanics.

## User commands

### subject add (subject) (subject: optional) (...)

Add access to the subject's channel. User has to have role allowed to do this (see [config](../config.md)'s `faceshifter/subject roles` entry).

### subject remove (subject) (subject: optional) (...)

Remove access to the subject's channel.

### role add (role) (role) (...)

Add requested role. If the role is below the bottom limiting role (named **---INTERESTS**), anyone can add it. If the role is above it and below the top limiting role (named **---PROGRAMMES**), user has to have role allowing him to do this (see [config](../config.md)'s `faceshifter/programme roles` entry). If the role is above the top limiting role, access is denied, as they have to be assigned manually.

**programme add (...)** is an alias.

### role remove (role) (role: optional) (...)

Remove requested role. Same rules apply as for **role add**.

**programme remove (...)** is an alias.

## Privileged commands

This module has no commands only usable by privileged users.

## Message reactions

If the message starts with a specific string (default is `Role` with newline, see [config](../config.md)'s `faceshifter/react-to-role prefix`) or is sent to dedicated channel, it is scanned for emoji-role combination. For every line, reaction is added; when the user clicks on that reaction, they go through the same process as if they have sent **role** or **subject** command.

Example:

```
Role
ü§ñ bot-development
üñåÔ∏è art
üö¥ sport
```
