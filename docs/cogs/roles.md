# Roles

This module allows users to self-assign some roles via react-to-role mechanics.

## Message reactions

If the message has been sent to dedicated channel, it is scanned for emoji-role combination. For every line, reaction is added; when the user clicks on that reaction, they are assigned a role or given access to a channel.

Example:

```
🤖 bot-development
🖌️ art
🚴 sport
```
