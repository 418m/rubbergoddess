# Usage

This document attempts to describe core functions.

## BASE cog

**uptime**

Sends uptime message

**week**

Tells if the current calender & study week is even or odd

**god (goddess, help)**

Displays embed with available commands

## VERIFY cog

Implements verification system. Requires some setting-up: a #jail channel with 
RW permission for @everyone, and a 'VERIFY' role (or other, as specified in 
config file). Other channels on a server should be visible only with at least 
'VERIFY' role. It is reccomended to have RO channel #jail-info visible only to 
users without 'VERIFY' role, so newcomers know what to do.

**getcode**

Request a security code. 

**verify**

Submit a security code from the e-mail.

## FITWIDE cog

## ACL cog

The bot assumes that a server has a '---' role, which separates self-assignable 
(hobby) and self-unassignable (MOD, VUT etc) roles. Anything below a '---' role 
can be added by users themselves by react-to-role mechanics, roles above can 
only be assigned by privileged user or by the bot.

## REVIEW cog

Allows to submit subject reviews, allowing for less formal notion compared to 
reviews in VUT's review system in its IS.

**reviews add**

Add a review in format `?review add <subject> <score> <text>`. For an anonymous 
submission, use `?review add <subject> <score> anonym <text>`..

**reviews remove**

Allows user to take his review back. Admin can delete any review.

**reviews <subject>**
