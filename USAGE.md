# Usage

This document attempts to describe cog functions.

## BASE cog

**uptime**

## VERIFY cog

Implements verification system. Requires some setting-up: a _#jail_ channel with 
RW permission for _@everyone_, and a _'VERIFY'_ role (or other, as specified in 
config file). Other channels on a server should only be visible with (at least) 
_'VERIFY'_ role. It is recommended to have RO channel _#jail-info_ visible only to 
users without _'VERIFY'_ role, so newcomers know what to do.

**getcode <class> <xlogin00>**

Request a security code. <class> is a role (_'FEKT'_, _'VUT'_ etc.), <xlogin00> 
is a VUT login or MUNI UÄŒO.

**verify <xlogin00> <code>**

Submit a security code. <xlogin00> is a VUT login or MUNI UÄŒO, <code> is a 
security code from verification e-mail.

## KARMA cog

Karma cog contains code for karma and react-to-role functionality.

An emote can have positive, neutral or negative karma value. By reacting with 
an emote users can rate each other, to show their (dis)approval of a post.

React-to-role allows users independent management of selected roles (hobby 
channels), while still having control over core privileged roles.

## ACL cog

The bot assumes that a server has a '---' role, which separates self-assignable

can be added by users themselves by react-to-role mechanics, roles above can 
only be assigned by privileged user or by the bot.
