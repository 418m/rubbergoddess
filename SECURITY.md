# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest [tag](https://github.com/sinus-x/rubbergoddess/tags).

`devel` branch is considered highly unstable, contains bugs and is not meant to be used in production in any way. Things change and break. Our bot usually runs on the `devel` so we can test the code before it goes official.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a bug or vulnerability, create an issue or contact us on our Discord server. We will do our best to fix the problem as soon as possible.
