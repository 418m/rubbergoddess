# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest commit in `master` branch is the only supported version. 
Because this project is closer to collection of scripts than to an
application on its own, we have decided that we won't be defining 
any versioning system.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a bug or vulnerability, create an issue. We will do our best 
to fix the problem as soon as possible.
