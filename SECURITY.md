# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest 
[tag](https://github.com/sinus-x/rubbergoddess/tags).

`devel` branch is considered highly unstable, contains bugs and
is not meant to be used in production in any way. Things change
and break -- daily.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a bug or vulnerability, create an issue. We will do our best
to fix the problem as soon as possible.
